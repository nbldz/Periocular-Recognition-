Deep Learning-Periocular Recognition 
Periocular recognition is a biometric technique that focuses on identifying individuals based on the region surrounding the eye, including the eyelids, eyelashes, eyebrows, and the immediate skin area. This method is often used in security systems and surveillance applications where the entire face or iris is not clearly visible, but the periocular region can still be captured.

Key features of periocular recognition include:

    Robustness in Partial Visibility: It can be used when full facial recognition is not possible, such as when someone is wearing a mask or headgear that covers part of the face but leaves the eye region exposed.

    Non-intrusive: Since it doesn't require close proximity or direct contact, it is non-intrusive, making it useful in public spaces and for remote applications.

    High Accuracy: Despite focusing on a smaller region of the face, periocular recognition is quite accurate due to the distinct features present in the eye region, including wrinkles, skin texture, and eyebrow shape.

    Complementary to Iris Recognition: While iris recognition relies on the patterns within the iris, periocular recognition uses the surrounding features. It can be a fallback when iris recognition fails due to poor lighting or image resolution.

Periocular recognition has applications in a range of industries, from border control and law enforcement to consumer electronics and personal authentication systems. Its importance has grown particularly in situations where face masks or other coverings have become more common.
